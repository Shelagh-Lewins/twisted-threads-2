# Twisted Threads 2

An app for tablet weaving built using Meteor 2.9 with React and Redux. It is the replacement for Twisted Threads.

This is built on top of the
[Meteor/React/Redux/Auth demo app](https://github.com/Shelagh-Lewins/meteor-react-redux-auth).

# Quick start

Install Meteor 2.9.

In a terminal window, cd into your Meteor directory. Then run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/Shelagh-Lewins/twisted-threads-2.git
cd twisted-threads-2
npm install
meteor
```

# Run with environment variables

To send emails, you'll need to provide a valid MAIL_URL.

To save pattern images and preview thumbnails, you'll need to provide AWS credentials.

1. Copy and rename the file `.env.template` to `.env`
2. Enter your mail and any other credentials in `.env`. NEVER commit `.env` to GitHub.
3. Start the app by executing the script `
run_meteor.js`

The script will first load the environment variables from .env and then run Meteor. This avoids using settings.json and better simulates a production environment.

# Tests

Run server-side tests by executing the script `test_meteor.sh`
