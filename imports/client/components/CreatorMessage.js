			<p>Hello, and welcome. I&apos;m Shelagh, the creator of Twisted Threads. TWT is free to use, but creating and maintaining it is a lot of work, and the server costs money. If you&apos;d like to support my work on TWT, I will be very grateful for any donations! You can donate using Patreon, Ko-fi or PayPal.</p>
